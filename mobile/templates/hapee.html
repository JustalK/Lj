	<span class="subtitle">Hapee.fr - Renting of motor home</span>
	<span class="descriptions"><strong>A</strong> website for renting motor home that i made all by myself for a society in the east of France. Apart from the design that was done by a designer, everything has been made by me in two months from scratch (the customer ask that we dont use any CMS), backend included. It's by far, the task that i have done the most complicated of my life from now and particularly the functionalities asked.</span>
	<span class="descriptions v2"><strong>T</strong>here are a lot of functionnalities on this website : <strong>a search by type, by cities, by department, an extranet, big forms, online payment in 1 or 2 times, systems of mails, systems of reviews, exports...</strong></span>
	<span class="descriptions"><strong>I</strong>n backend, there are a lof of work too for giving to the admins a total freedom on their website. At each functionality, there is an admin interface.</span>
	<span class="descriptions v2"><strong>I</strong> did not use a lot of librairies. In fact, I'va just used <strong>Jquery</strong> for the differents scripts, <strong>MPDF</strong> for making some beautifuls bills and <strong>CKEditor</strong> (for the admin). I have also used some webservices : <strong>API Google Map and analytics, API avis vérifiés, API Sherlock</strong>.</span>
	<span class="descriptions"><strong>T</strong>he extranet has also been a good challenge. For feeling the motor home, i have to think about how to give motivation to the user to fill up the big forms. So I came up with some good animation for animating the forms. I'va also used the AJAX for saving the informations in the case that the user does not reach the end of the forms in one time.</span>
	<span class="descriptions v2"><strong>A</strong>n other interesting point was the systems of reservations. There are two mode of reservations. The first one is classical, if the user has activated this option, the reservations are automatically validate. The other mode is the manual system, the user have a moderation on the reservation made. He can choose to accept or refuse a reservation. This kind of system is quite cool but require some kind a special process for the mails, the paiement and the reservations.</span>
	<span class="descriptions"><strong>T</strong>his website is also the first one where I have done a ATOS payment in two times. It's not very complicated but that implied some kind of thinking/process differents that when you made a simple one time payement.</span></span>
	<span class="descriptions v2"><strong>F</strong>inally, this project was very nice and I learn a lot doing it. I'm now ready for any E-commerce website, even if I have to do it from scratch like this one.</span>
